This project was at done at EPITECH, 3 months after I joined it and over 2 months.

It's is, and by FAR, the project I enjoyed the most.
I did it alone while my teammate Guillaume Mardon was doing a bonus graphic interface.

I may come back (or not) later to change it, upgrade it and imporve this README... Who knows ? ^^
